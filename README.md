## Known issues and limitations

* If there are large number of applications in /usr/share/applications, app icons will overlap with system icons. This can be fixed by hiding apps in weston.ini.
* Misconfigured or broken audio such as AMD HDMI audio can cause crash on startup. As a workaround audio setup should be fixed. For example for AMD HDMI audio built-in soundcard can be used as a workaround - e.g by setting snd_hda_intel.index=1,0 if built in soundcard comes as second when running aplay -l
* Multimonitor support - not tested after removal of GTK
* Need to restart weston after a new app installation to see the new app icon in the panel.


Icons are taken from Adwaita icon theme - https://github.com/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme
